<h3> <img src="https://github.com/Parply/Parply/blob/master/.github/Hi.gif?raw=true" width="30px"> Hi there </h3> 

<p> I have been working with web development since 2017, the
period during which I have worked on different projects. I have
also worked in a Startup Company from 2019 to 2020 as a
software and hardware engineer. I am a self-motivated and
self-taught professional who likes to solve problems.
I combine a desire for usability with a user experience with
technical knowledge to create a great digital experience. My
repertoire includes programming languages and tools such as
ReactJS, NextJs, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Nginx server
configuration, Docker, Kubernetes, RestApi, MVC, and more.
